# Introduction to Python
Python is loved because:
- High level general purpose language that is applied in lots of problems
- Large library of modules for many different tasks and extensive documentation.
    * For Data Science: Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib
    * For AI: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn 
    * For NLP: Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Great mentorship 

# Introduction to R
- Free GNU (General Public License) but not open source. 
    * Both Open Source and Free Software support collaboration. Open Source thend to be business focused while Free software is more focues on values.
- Supported by wide global community 
- Most often for statisticians, mathematicians, data miners for stat software, graphing and data analysis developement. 
- The array-oriented syntax makes it easy to translate math to code esp with minimal coding background.
- Has the world's largest reposityory of stat knowledge
- Lots of publicly released packages for complex exploratory data analysis
- Integrates well with other programming languages
