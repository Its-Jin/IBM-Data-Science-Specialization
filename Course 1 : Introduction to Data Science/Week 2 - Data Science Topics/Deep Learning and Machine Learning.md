| Subset of AI | Subset of Machine Learning |
| Make decisions based of learned examples | Uses neural networks to make decisions by continuously learning on the job due to its ability to categorize information and identify patterns |
| Plateaus as data volume increases | Use of neural network layers where small computing units always process incoming data thus is able to handle increasing data volumes |

# Data Science Vs AI 
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses AI techniques to derive insights from data.

# Applications of Machine Learning
- Classifications
- Cluster analysis
- Market basket analysis
- Group purchase 
- Predictive analysis 
    * where there is a shift from understanding the details of various techniques are used to understanding their limitations. 

#### Applications of machine learning in fintech industries 
- Recommendations of products
    * you have invested in x, y is a good investment also because they are similar - learning from history patterns
- Fraud detection
    * learning spenind patterns to access the validity of transaction in real time.
