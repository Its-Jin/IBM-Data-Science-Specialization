# Evaluate Numeric Dataset UCI:Forest Fires 
[Forest Fires Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires)

Pauol Cortez and Anibal Morais aimed to predict the burned area of forest fires in the notheast region of Portugal, by using meterological and other data. 

Attribute information:
X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
month - month of the year: "jan" to "dec"
day - day of the week: "mon" to "sun"
FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6
ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4
area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 (this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make sense to model with the logarithm transform).

# Evaluate Non-Numeric Dataset
[Airbnb Data for Analytics: Trentino Reviews](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/9fc8543fabfc26f908cf0c592cf27867?context=cpdaas)

The dataset comprises of three main tables:
- listings - Detailed listings data showing 96 attributes for each of the listings. Some of the attributes used in the analysis are price(continuous), longitude (continuous), latitude (continuous), listing_type (categorical), is_superhost (categorical), neighbourhood (categorical), ratings (continuous) among others.
- reviews - Detailed reviews given by the guests with 6 attributes. Key attributes include date (datetime), listing_id (discrete), reviewer_id (discrete) and comment (textual).
- calendar - Provides details about booking for the next year by listing. Four attributes in total including listing_id (discrete), date(datetime), available (categorical) and price (continuous).

Some possible uses for data includes:
- analysis of star ratings of places
- location preferences
- analysis of tone and sentiment in reviews
- analysis of areas of dissastifaction 


# Evaluating Jupyter Notebooks
[Finding Optimal Locations for New Stores](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/aceccfd155454fd9741852e12e9cce4e?context=cpdaas)
The notebook shows you how **Decision Optimization** can help to prescribe decisions for a complex constrained problem using Python to help determine the optimal location for a new store.

While visualizing locations of existing stores can provide great insights, it do not allow us to determin the locaiton of a new store easily. This is where an optimization model can be beneficial.
