# What is data science
The use of data to understand the world through uncovering insights and trends by manipulating and exploring data. A significant part of data science is **data analysis**

Data Science is based on concepts from other fields and it is a new application for existing concepts. Common concepts include:
- algebra
- linear algebra
- programming
- databases 
- machine learning
- 

As part of the data analysis process:
- understanding the scope and focus are crucial - Identify the problem 
- followed by identification of appropriate data to answer the research question - Gather the data
- the approach to analysis varies and usually multiple methods are considered - identify the tools to use
- following the analysis, storytelling abilities help to communicate the data to others.

Data Science act as a means to solve existing problems by providing insights to these problems and allowing strategic decisions. 

# Common Topics in Data Science
- Regression 
- Data Visualization 
- Artificial neural networks 
- Nearest neighbour 
- Structured data - tablular data
- Unstructured data - videos, audio, text - more complex and time consuming to first make structured
