# The report structure
The report structure is largely dependent on the length of the document 

| Shorter Report | Longer Report |
|----------------|---------------|
| Presents a summary of findings therefore to the point | Incrementally builds the arguement with details of the work done |
| Purpose: commentaries on current trends | Purpose: critical review of subject matter thus making it more involved |


# Format for Reports
